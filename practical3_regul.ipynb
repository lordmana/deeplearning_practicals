Said otherwise, our model would quickly start to _overfit_ to the training data. Overfitting happens in every single machine learning problem. Learning how to deal with overfitting is essential to mastering machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fundamental issue in machine learning is the tension between optimization and generalization. \"Optimization\" refers to the process of adjusting a model to get the best performance possible on the training data (the \"learning\" in \"machine learning\"), while \"generalization\" refers to how well the trained model would perform on data it has never seen before. The goal of the game is to get good generalization, of course, but you do not control generalization directly; you can only adjust the model based on its training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the beginning of training, optimization and generalization are correlated: the lower your loss on training data, the lower your loss on test data. While this is happening, your model is said to be _under-fit_ : there is still progress to be made; the network hasn't yet modeled all relevant patterns in the training data. But after a certain number of iterations on the training data, generalization stops improving, validation metrics stall, then start degrading: the model is then starting to over-fit, i.e. is it starting to learn patterns that are specific to the training data but that are misleading or irrelevant when it comes to new data.\n",

        "To prevent a model from learning misleading or irrelevant patterns found in the training data, _the best solution is of course to get more training data_. A model trained on more data will naturally generalize better. When that is no longer possible, the next best solution is to modulate the quantity of information that your model is allowed to store, or to add constraints on what information it is allowed to store. If a network can only afford to memorize a small number of patterns, the optimization process will force it to focus on the most prominent patterns, which have a better chance of generalizing well.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest way to prevent overfitting is to reduce the size of the model, i.e. the number of learnable parameters in the model (which is determined by the number of layers and the number of units per layer). In deep learning, the number of learnable parameters in a model is often referred to as the model's \"capacity\". Intuitively, a model with more parameters will have more \"memorization capacity\" and therefore will be able to easily learn a perfect dictionary-like mapping between training samples and their targets, a mapping without any generalization power. Always keep this in mind: deep learning models tend to be good at fitting the training data, but the real challenge is generalization, not fitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn this mapping as easily, and thus, in order to minimize its loss, it will have to resort to learning compressed representations that have predictive power regarding the targets -- precisely the type of representations that we are interested in. At the same time, keep in mind that you should be using models that have enough parameters that they won't be underfitting: your model shouldn't be starved for memorization resources. There is a compromise to be found between \"too much capacity\" and \"not enough capacity\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, there is no magical formula to determine what the right number of layers is, or what the right size for each layer is. You will have to evaluate an array of different architectures (on your validation set, not on your test set, of course) in order to find the right model size for your data. The general workflow to find an appropriate model size is to start with relatively few layers and parameters, and start increasing the size of the layers or adding new layers until you see diminishing returns with regard to the validation loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's try this on our movie review classification network. Our original network, a two hidden layer network with 16 units per hidden layer, was able to reach ~84% of accuracy. Let's try replacing it with a smaller network that has only 4 units per hidden layer. Let's also add to this benchmark a network that has much more capacity, far more than the problem would warrant: 256 units per hidden layer. Create and train the two models, then plot the validation loss of the three architectures."

Dropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly \"dropping out\" (i.e. setting to zero) a number of output features of the layer during training. Let's say a given layer would normally have returned a vector `[0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1]` for a given input sample during training; after applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries distributed at random, e.g. `[0, 0.5, 1.3, 0, 1.1]`. The \"dropout rate\" is the fraction of the features that are being zeroed-out; it is usually set between 0.2 and 0.5. At test time, no units are dropped out, and instead the layer's output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, so as to \n",
